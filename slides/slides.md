+ relaxing on a tropical **beach**?

  + and what kind receive **woe**
+ When we **remember** prophets of old
  + and look **forward** to Christ's return,
+ we must adjust our **value** system:
  + what we deem as **good**, successful
  + important, worth **pursuing**

  + **unable** to provide for himself,
  + who relies on the **charity** of others
