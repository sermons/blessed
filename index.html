# What constitutes <br> a **blessed** life?

>>>
+ is it about **comfort**? no **lack** / **suffering**?
+ leaving **legacy**, being **recog** / apprec by others?

+ Encourages us to look **back** to prophets of old
  + and **forward** to Christ's return;
+ Challg. us in the **now** to change **value** system:
  + what we deem as **good**, successful
  + important, worth **pursuing**
+ Together, turn attention to **God's** value system

“Blessed are you when people **hate** you<br>
and when they **exclude** you and **revile** you<br>
and spurn your **name** as evil,<br>
on account of the **Son of Man**!

[23](# "ref")
**Rejoice** in that day, and **leap** for joy,<br>
for behold, your **reward** is great in heaven;<br>
for so their fathers did to the **prophets**.

>>>
+ See life through **Your** eyes
  + **value** what You value, prioritize
+ Not to pursue worldly **riches** that 
  + fade away like the **flowers**
+ But to realize how **destitute** we are
  + before Your **glory** + holiness
+ Oh, how **rich** it is to know we are **forgiven**!
+ Not to be **content** w/comfortable lives
  + while world **devours** itself in sin
+ But always be **hungry** for Your righteousness
  + Godly **sorrow** that leads to repentance
+ Not to **say** what people want to **hear**
  + whatever **clickbait** gets most **likes**
+ But proclaim Your **Word** boldly as OT **prophets** did
  + **leaping** for joy to be considered
  + **worthy** of suffering for Your Name
+ To rediscover **truly blessed** life in You
